# MemberManager
For my JavaScript course through Code Louisville, this app is for managing and updating member information for group leaders.

---

I plan on meeting the following project requirements as outlined in the course syllabus:

- [ ] Your application must have a responsive design through the use of media queries, Bootstrap, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and/or other similar approaches - we need to ensure that you can integrate your new JavaScript skills with your HTML/CSS skills you previously learned
  - [ ] Use CSS FlexBox to make design responsive on all screensizes.
- [ ] Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits
- [X] Project includes a README file
- [ ] Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app
- [ ] Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
- [ ] Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
